# Readable

Post and comment on shared content. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need an up to date version of Node.js (developed using 6.11.4) 

### Installing

Start by cloning a copy to your computer.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PatrickFranz/readable.git
```

Change to that directory
```bash
  cd readable
```

Install the dependancies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the Readable App
```
  npm start
```




End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
